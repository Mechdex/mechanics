    Environmental Hazards are elements of the game world that can inflict damage or a negative status effect on the player through proximity or contact. This can include natural hazards like pools of lava, deep water, or toxic gas vents, as well as man-made dangers like electrified floors, fields of radiation, or spinning blades.

      description: |
        If the entire game world is safe to walk on, traversal becomes a simple act of holding forward with no engagement. Environmental hazards solve this. They turn the environment itself into an antagonist, forcing the player to be mindful of their surroundings and creating traversal puzzles where the path itself is a source of challenge.
