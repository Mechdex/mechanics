  long_description: |
    A Dynamic Ecosystem is a complex simulation where different forms of AI life (predators, prey, herbivores) and sometimes even flora interact with each other and the environment based on a set of systemic rules. These systems are designed to create unscripted, emergent behaviors, such as predators hunting prey, animals traveling in herds to specific water sources, or scavengers appearing at a fresh kill.

        It's a design challenge to make a game's wildlife feel authentic when every animal is just a mindless, wandering prop on a pre-set path. A dynamic ecosystem solves this by creating a web of interacting AI systems. This results in emergent, unscripted events that make the world feel like a living, breathing place that exists independently of the player's actions.

        Features an incredibly detailed ecosystem. Animals have daily routines, predators hunt prey, carcasses attract scavengers, and the player's actions (like over-hunting) can have a noticeable impact on the local animal population.

        The ecosystem is a source of chaotic, emergent gameplay. It's common for the player's carefully planned stealth infiltration of an outpost to be ruined (or aided) by a wild tiger suddenly attacking the guards.
