  long_description: |
    Pathfinding is an AI process that finds a viable route for an entity to move from a starting point to a destination, navigating around obstacles. It operates on a simplified representation of the game world, often a 'navigation mesh' (navmesh) or a grid of waypoints. Algorithms like A* (A-star) are commonly used to calculate the most efficient path through this data structure. The result is a series of points that the AI character follows to reach its target.

        It's a fundamental design problem: an NPC needs to get from point A to B, but the level has walls, furniture, and other obstacles. Without a system to navigate these, the character would get stuck or walk through walls, breaking immersion. Pathfinding provides the essential logic for characters to intelligently navigate complex game worlds.
  examples:
    - title: "The Last of Us"

        The companion AI relies heavily on pathfinding to navigate the cluttered, post-apocalyptic environments alongside the player, rarely getting stuck or taking nonsensical routes, which is crucial for maintaining immersion.

        In this real-time strategy game, pathfinding is critical for managing hundreds of units at once. Units must efficiently navigate around each other and terrain to engage targets, and the quality of the pathfinding directly impacts the game's tactical depth.
