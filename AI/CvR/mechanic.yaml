    A Cover System allows both players and AI characters to use environmental objects for protection during combat. It's a foundational mechanic in third-person shooters. The system typically involves a context-sensitive input to "stick" to cover, with additional actions for peeking out, blind-firing, and moving between adjacent cover points. For AI, it involves logic for identifying, pathfinding to, and utilizing cover positions effectively.

      description: |
        In a shooter without cover, combat can devolve into static "run-and-gun" scenarios. A Cover System introduces tactical positioning as a core pillar of combat. It breaks up sightlines and creates a battlefield with distinct safe and dangerous zones, forcing both the player and AI to constantly evaluate their position and maneuver for an advantage.
  examples:
    - title: "Gears of War"

        This series popularized the modern third-person cover system. The 'roadie run' and fluid vaulting between chest-high walls defined its tactical, stop-and-pop combat rhythm and became the standard for the genre.
    - title: "The Last of Us"

        Features a 'soft' cover system where the player character naturally uses the environment for protection without a sticky button press. This creates a more fluid and desperate-feeling combat experience, fitting the game's survivalist tone.
