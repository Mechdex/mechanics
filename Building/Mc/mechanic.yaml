    Modular Construction is a "snap-together" building system that uses a limited set of pre-fabricated, interlocking pieces (like floors, walls, and ramps). These pieces are designed to connect to each other seamlessly, often on a grid system, allowing for rapid and intuitive building. This method contrasts with more granular, free-form systems like voxel-based construction.

      description: |
        Free-form building systems can be overwhelming and often result in ugly, non-functional structures for unskilled players. A modular system solves this by using a limited set of easy-to-use, snap-together pieces. This guarantees that even novice builders can create structurally sound and aesthetically
