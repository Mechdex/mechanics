  long_description: |
    A Blueprint is a system that saves a structure's layout, either as a pre-designed template from the developer or as a player-created design. This saved data is then used to project a "ghost" image of the structure into the world. Players can then either automatically build the structure by providing the required resources, or use the projection as a guide for manual construction.

    - title: "Repetitive construction tasks"
      description: |
        Manually building complex or identical structures over and over is tedious and discourages large-scale projects. The Blueprint system automates this repetition. It lets players save their favorite designs and deploy them instantly, turning a time-consuming chore into a satisfying strategic decision.

      description: |
        The complexity of a building system can intimidate less creative players who don't know where to start. Blueprints, when offered as pre-designed templates, provide an accessible entry point. They give players functional and cool-looking structures immediately, letting them enjoy the benefits of building without needing to be an expert architect.
