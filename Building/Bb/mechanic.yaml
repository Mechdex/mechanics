    Base Building is a system that allows players to construct persistent, customized structures and settlements using in-game resources. It functions as a core gameplay loop in many survival and sandbox games, offering a functional hub for crafting and storage, as well as a canvas for player creativity. The systems can range from placing pre-fabricated structures to free-form construction using individual pieces like walls and floors.

        In open-ended sandbox games, players can run out of directed content, leading to disengagement. Base building provides a long-term, self-directed project. It gives players a creative outlet and a persistent investment in the world, keeping them engaged long after scripted quests are complete.

        It's a design challenge to make a large game world feel personal to every player. Base building solves this by allowing players to physically alter the world and create a unique home. This fosters a strong sense of ownership and attachment that a pre-designed world cannot.

        Features a free-form, piece-by-piece building system with structural integrity physics. This design turns base building into an engineering puzzle, where players must create structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing Norse longhouses.
