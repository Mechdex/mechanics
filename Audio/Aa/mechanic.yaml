    Ambient Audio is the background soundscape of a game world, designed to create a sense of place and atmosphere. It consists of layered, non-interactive sounds like wind, distant city noise, crickets chirping, or the subtle hum of machinery. These soundscapes are often location-based and can change dynamically based on the time of day or weather. Unlike specific sound effects, ambient audio provides a constant, underlying sonic texture to the environment.

        A visually detailed game world can feel sterile and empty if it's silent. Ambient Audio solves this by providing a constant soundscape. It adds a crucial layer of depth and atmosphere that makes an environment feel like a real, living place rather than a digital set piece.

        The game uses its ambient audio to build a powerful sense of dread and loneliness. The wind howling across the plains, the distant cry of a mutant, and the crackle of anomalies are all part of a soundscape that is central to the game's oppressive atmosphere.

        The ambient audio of Rapture is essential to its character. The constant groaning of the city's structure, distant drips of water, and ghostly advertisements from the past create a haunting soundscape that tells a story in itself.
