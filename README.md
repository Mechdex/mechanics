# Mechdex DB
This is the repository that contains all the game mechanics stored for Mechdex. It's free for anyone to contribute to. 

## Contributing
Mechanics are stored in the following (highly inefficient but easy to write) way:
 - The repository contains one directory for every category.
 - Each category contains an index.json file that lists the symbol, name and a short description for every mechanic in that category.
 - Within each of these directories, one folder is made for each mechanic, named after the symbol. The folder contains a single file, `mechanic.yaml`.
 - The structure is like this:
 -  - Main repository
    -   - Category1
        -   - index.json
        -   - Symbol1
            -   - mechanic.yaml
              - Symbol2
              - - mechanic.yaml
        - Category2
        - - Symbol3
            -   - mechanic.yaml
          - Symbol4
            -   - mechanic.yaml

  So to create a new mechanic:
  1. Fork this repository. If you're not sure what that means, read up on a quick guide on how collaboration works on Github.
  1. Identify the right category.
  2. Within the category's folder, create a new folder with the name being the new mechanic's symbol, i.e., `Dj` or `Rc`.
  3. Within this new folder, create a file `mechanic.yaml` (verbatim). Use another mechanic as a template and fill in the details of this mechanic.
  4. Once done, update the `index.json` file of the category's folder to include your new mechanic's symbol, name and short description.
  5. Submit a pull request back to this repository. It'll be reviewed and merged.
