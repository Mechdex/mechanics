    A Critical Hit, or "crit," is a combat mechanic where, based on a random chance (a "crit rate" percentage), an attack will deal a significantly increased amount of damage. The damage multiplier (e.g., 200%) and the chance to trigger a crit are often key stats that can be improved by a character's attributes or gear.

        If every attack deals a fixed amount of damage, combat can become a purely mathematical and predictable exercise. Critical hits solve this by introducing an element of random chance. The possibility of a sudden burst of damage adds a layer of excitement and unpredictability to every encounter, creating memorable high-roll moments.

        Critical Hit Chance and Critical Hit Damage are two of the most important stats for increasing a character's damage output. The entire end-game gearing process revolves around maximizing these stats to create massive, screen-clearing bursts of damage.

        Critical hits are a core part of the game's brutal probability-based combat. A well-timed critical hit can save a mission, while an enemy landing a lucky crit on a key soldier can be devastating, creating high-stakes tension.
