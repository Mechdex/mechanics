    A Dice Roll is a mechanic that uses a random number generator (RNG) to simulate the outcome of rolling one or more dice. The result is typically an integer within a defined range (e.g., 1-6 or 1-20) that directly influences a gameplay outcome. This can include movement distance on a board, the success or failure of an action, or the amount of damage dealt in a tabletop-style RPG.

        It's a design challenge in turn-based games that if every action has a fixed result, the game can become a solved mathematical puzzle. A dice roll solves this by introducing a core element of chance. It ensures that no two turns are exactly alike and that even a losing player has a chance to turn the tables with a lucky roll.

        The dice block is the central mechanic. A player's roll determines their movement on the game board, creating an unpredictable and chaotic party game experience where luck is as important as skill.

        The game is a faithful adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons, and nearly every action—from attacking to persuading to disarming traps—is resolved by a virtual roll of a 20-sided die, with the result shown to the player.
