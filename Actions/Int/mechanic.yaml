    The Interact mechanic is the fundamental bridge between the player and the game world's objects, characters, and systems. The implementation is context-sensitive: the game engine detects when the player is near an interactable entity and presents a prompt for a specific action. This can range from a single-button system where the game determines the action to a menu-based system that offers the player multiple choices.

    Advanced implementations include 'held' interactions, where holding a button for a duration creates tension or represents effort, such as reviving a teammate or disarming a trap.

        A rich game world may contain dozens of unique types of interactions, but a controller has a limited number of buttons. Assigning a unique button for every action ('Open Door', 'Talk', 'Loot') would create an impossibly complex control scheme. A context-sensitive Interact mechanic solves this. It funnels dozens of potential world interactions through a single, intelligent input.
  examples:
    - title: "Red Dead Redemption 2"

        Features a deep, context-sensitive system where a single button prompts different interactions based on a secondary choice. This allows for nuanced social interactions with any NPC, making the world feel incredibly alive and reactive to the player's mood and intent.
    - title: "Death Stranding"
      description: |
        Interaction is elevated to a core mechanic where the simple act of picking up, stacking, and managing cargo is a complex, physics-based puzzle. This design turns mundane interactions into the central gameplay loop, focusing on the physicality and challenge of moving through the world.
