  long_description: |
    Interaction mechanics allow players to engage with objects, NPCs, and the environment in meaningful ways. This can include opening doors, talking to characters, picking up items, and solving puzzles. In many games, interaction is context-sensitive, meaning different actions become available depending on the situation. 
    
    Open-world games like Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption rely heavily on interaction systems to create immersive environments. From looting bodies to petting animals, these mechanics bring the world to life. Some games simplify interactions with a single-button prompt, while others use complex UI systems to offer a variety of contextual choices.
