  long_description: |
    Blocking allows players to defend against incoming attacks using a shield, weapon, or other defensive tool. When a block is performed, it typically reduces or nullifies damage from an incoming strike, depending on the gameâ€™s mechanics. Some games allow perfect blocks, which negate all damage, while others may implement chip damage where a fraction of the attack still gets through. 
    
    The effectiveness of blocking varies by game design. In action-heavy games like the Batman: Arkham series, blocking is fluid and intuitive, allowing players to seamlessly counterattack. In more tactical combat systems, such as those found in fighting games, blocking may be tied to directional input or frame-perfect timing. Shields, weapons, or even parries can all be used to execute a block, making it a fundamental part of defensive play.

    - Stale combat: When combat in your game boils down to repeatedly attacking the enemy, it can get boring. A Block action adds a new dimension to combat, and usually becomes as important to gameplay as your Attack action.
  examples:
  - 'Batman: Arkham series: Blocking enemy strikes with gadgets and counters.'
  - 'Street Fighter series: High and low blocks to counter various attacks.'
