  long_description: |
    Block is a defensive action that mitigates or nullifies incoming damage, typically from a frontal arc. Its implementation is defined by its resource cost—almost always Stamina or a hidden 'poise' value. Sustaining hits on a block consumes this resource, and depleting it results in a 'Guard Break,' a state of vulnerability that punishes passive over-reliance on the mechanic.

    The effectiveness of a block (damage reduction, stability) is determined by the equipment used, such as a heavy shield versus a weapon. Combat systems often include 'unblockable' attacks to ensure players must utilize other defensive options, adding a layer to the combat puzzle.

        It's a challenge to design combat in tight spaces like hallways, as the player's ability to dodge is severely limited by the environment. The Block action solves this by providing a defense that requires no lateral or backward movement. It enables players to manage threats head-on in confined spaces, making hallway ambushes a viable design.

        Blocking is a high-commitment action directly tied to the Stamina bar. Shields possess a 'Stability' stat that determines the stamina cost of a blocked hit. This design makes blocking a deliberate resource management choice, forcing players to weigh safety against the stamina needed for counter-attacking.

        This system features a timed 'bash' that can be performed while blocking. A successful bash staggers an opponent, creating an opening for a counter-attack. This design rewards proactive defense and integrates the block action directly into the player's offensive rotation.
