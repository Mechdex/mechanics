    Dodge is a defensive action that allows a character to avoid damage by rapidly changing their position. The core of the mechanic lies in "invincibility frames" (i-frames)—a brief window during the animation where the character is completely immune to damage. This allows players to pass through attacks unharmed, not just move out of their way. Its usage is almost always tied to a Stamina resource to prevent spamming.

    Implementations vary in speed and distance, from long-distance rolls with larger i-frame windows to quick, short-range dashes. Unlike blocking, which absorbs damage at a fixed position, dodging is a commitment of movement that rewards precise timing and spatial awareness.

        It's difficult to design spectacular attacks, like full-screen shockwaves, that are impossible to outrun. Without a specific counter, these attacks feel unfair. A Dodge mechanic, with its i-frames, resolves this impasse. It allows the player to survive a spatially unavoidable attack through precise timing, giving the designer freedom to create these encounters without sacrificing fairness.

        The dodge roll is the primary defensive tool, with its effectiveness tied to the player's 'Equip Load' stat. A lower load grants a faster roll with more i-frames, while a higher load results in a slow 'fat roll.' This design directly links the dodge mechanic to character building.

        This game replaces the defensive roll with an aggressive, shorter-range 'quick-step.' This encourages players to stay close to enemies and dodge *into* attacks to set up counter-hits with the Regain system. It transforms dodging from a purely defensive act into a core part of the offensive rhythm.
