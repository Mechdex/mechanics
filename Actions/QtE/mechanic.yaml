    A Quick Time Event (QTE) is a scripted interaction where the player must press a prompted button, or sequence of buttons, within a short time limit. Its primary function is to maintain player engagement during a non-interactive or highly cinematic sequence, effectively bridging the gap between active gameplay and passive cutscenes.

    The design of a QTE is defined by its consequences and presentation. Failure can result in instant death, a minor penalty, or a branching narrative path. Modern implementations often favor less intrusive UI and more meaningful outcomes to avoid breaking player immersion.

        A game's core verbs (move, jump, attack) can't cover every unique action a cinematic story beat might demand. You may have a specific animation for a dramatic feat, like holding a door shut, with no way to trigger it via the standard controls. QTEs are a simple way to connect one-off actions to the game without breaking immersion or building a massive action set.

        To keep players engaged during long cinematics, designers need a form of light interaction. QTEs provide this by using minimal, clearly telegraphed prompts for simple actions. This keeps the player focused as an active participant without cluttering the screen with a full UI. As a bonus, it also prevents the jarring 'fumble for the controller' when the scene suddenly demands input.
