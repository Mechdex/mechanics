    Quick Time Events (QTEs) require players to press buttons within a short window of time to successfully complete an action. These events are often used in cinematic sequences to maintain player engagement during cutscenes or dramatic moments. Some QTEs offer branching outcomes, while others simply determine success or failure. 
    
    Games like God of War utilize QTEs for finishing moves and boss battles, adding spectacle to combat. Heavy Rain takes a different approach, integrating QTEs into the core gameplay, where player reactions shape the narrative. While sometimes criticized for being overused, well-implemented QTEs can enhance immersion and tension.

    - Lack of player engagement: QTEs ensure that players remain active participants in dramatic sequences rather than just watching them unfold. In contrast, to keep players engaged, the cutscene would have to be real-time, which is the other extreme. QTEs are a good compromise.
  examples:
  - 'God of War: QTEs during boss fights, where timed inputs execute cinematic finishers.'
  - 'Heavy Rain: Narrative-driven QTEs that influence story outcomes based on player reaction speed and accuracy.'
