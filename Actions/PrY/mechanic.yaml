  long_description: |
    Parrying allows players to deflect an enemy attack with precise timing, often opening the opponent up for a counterattack. Unlike blocking, which mitigates damage, parrying turns an opponent’s strength against them by staggering them or creating a brief vulnerability. 
    
    In games like Dark Souls, parrying requires pinpoint timing, rewarding skillful play with devastating ripostes. Sekiro refines this further with a posture system where successful parries weaken an enemy’s defenses, leading to an execution move. Parrying mechanics add risk-versus-reward elements, making combat more engaging for skilled players.

    - Stale combat: When combat in your game boils down to repeatedly attacking the enemy, it can get boring. A Parry action adds a new dimension to combat, and usually becomes as important to gameplay as your Attack action.
  examples:
  - 'Dark Souls: Parrying enemy attacks with shields or weapons to create openings for counterattacks.'
  - 'Dead Cells: Parrying is crucial in Dead Cells, and most enemy attacks can be parried. This usually has a rebound effect and damages or stuns the enemy.'
  - 'Sekiro: Precision-based parrying system that gradually breaks an enemy’s posture, leading to a finishing blow.'
