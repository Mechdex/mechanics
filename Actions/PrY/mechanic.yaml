  long_description: |
    A Parry is a high-skill defensive action that deflects an incoming attack if timed correctly within a very brief active window. Unlike a block, which mitigates damage, a successful parry typically negates all damage and immediately puts the attacker into a vulnerable 'stagger' or 'riposte' state. This creates a massive opening for a counter-attack, making it the ultimate risk-versus-reward defensive maneuver.

    The risk is absolute: missing the parry window leaves the player completely open to taking full damage. To ensure fairness, designers often include specific 'unparryable' attacks, telegraphed with a unique visual cue, which force the player to rely on other defensive options.

        When both the player and an enemy have strong defensive options, combat can devolve into a stalemate where each party waits for the other to drop their guard. A Parry mechanic breaks this deadlock. It introduces a high-risk, timing-based option that defeats a standard block or attack, instantly turning a defensive situation into a decisive offensive advantage.

        The 'Deflect' system is the game's central mechanic, used offensively to break enemy 'Posture.' This design makes the parry the primary tool for creating finishing blows, as opposed to just a defensive counter.

        The 'Red Parry' is iconic for its high skill ceiling and its role in competitive history. It allows a player to parry multi-hit super moves by repeatedly timing the input, leading to spectacular, viewer-friendly displays of mastery.
