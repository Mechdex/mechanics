  long_description: |
    Cover Shooting is a combat style that merges a Cover System with ranged combat mechanics. It allows a character to "stick" to environmental objects for protection, and from that safe position, perform a variety of actions like peeking out to aim, firing blindly over the top, or moving to adjacent cover points. It is the defining mechanic of many modern third-person shooters.
  short_description: Engage in ranged combat from protected positions.

  - title: Dynamic battlefield positioning
    description: |
      In a shooter without cover, combat can devolve into static "run-and-gun" scenarios. A Cover Shooting system introduces tactical positioning as a core pillar of combat. It breaks up sightlines and creates a battlefield with distinct safe and dangerous zones, forcing players to constantly evaluate their position and maneuver for an advantage.
  examples:
  - title: Gears of War (series)

      This series defined the modern cover shooter. The weight of the characters and the satisfying "thunk" of snapping into cover became iconic, creating a deliberate, tactical combat rhythm of suppression and flanking.
  - title: The Division (series)

      Features a cover-to-cover movement system that allows players to seamlessly move between protected positions with a single button press. This makes repositioning under fire a fluid and core part of its tactical, squad-based encounters.
