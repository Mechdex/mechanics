  long_description: |
    A Charge Attack is a combat action where the player holds down an input button to build up power, then releases it to unleash a more powerful version of an attack. The design is defined by the trade-off between the time spent charging (a window of vulnerability) and the increased damage, area of effect, or special properties (like breaking a guard) of the resulting attack.
  short_description: Hold to build, release for a powerful strike.

  - title: One-note combat rhythm
    description: |
      If all attacks are instantaneous button presses, combat can devolve into a repetitive, button-mashing rhythm. Charge attacks solve this by introducing a new timing element. They create a risk-reward cadence of finding a safe moment to charge and timing the release, adding a layer of deliberate pacing to the fight.
  examples:
  - title: Mega Man (series)

      The Mega Buster's charge shot is a core mechanic. It allows players to deal significantly more damage than rapid-fire shots, rewarding them for finding openings in enemy patterns to safely charge their weapon.
  - title: Monster Hunter (series)
    description: |
      Weapons like the Great Sword and Hammer are built around charge attacks. Their slow, deliberate nature forces players to learn a monster's attack patterns intimately to find the large windows of opportunity needed to land a fully charged blow.
