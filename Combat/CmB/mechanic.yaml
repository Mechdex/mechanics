  long_description: |
    A Combo System is a combat mechanic that allows and rewards players for chaining different attacks together in a fluid sequence. Rather than individual, disconnected button presses, the system recognizes specific sequences (e.g., Light-Light-Heavy) and executes a unique, powerful "combo" move as a result. These systems often feature a combo counter or style meter to track and reward performance.

    description: |
      In a simple combat system where every button press has the same outcome, there is little to distinguish a new player from a veteran. A combo system solves this by creating a high skill ceiling. It provides a deep set of moves and sequences for dedicated players to learn and master, rewarding them with increased damage and stylish efficiency.
  examples:
