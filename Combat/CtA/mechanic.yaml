  long_description: |
    A Counter Attack is a special move that can only be performed immediately after a successful defensive action, such as a block, dodge, or parry. It is a reactive mechanic that turns a defensive success directly into an offensive opportunity. The counter attack itself often has special properties, such as dealing extra damage, staggering the enemy, or having invincibility frames.

      When both the player and an enemy have strong defensive options, combat can devolve into a stalemate where each party waits for the other to drop their guard. A Counter Attack breaks this deadlock. It directly rewards a successful defensive action with guaranteed damage, incentivizing players to actively engage with enemy attacks rather than simply waiting.

      The 'Freeflow' combat system is built around counter attacks. A visual cue indicates an incoming attack, and a correctly timed counter not only prevents damage but seamlessly continues Batman's combo chain, making defense a fluid part of the offensive rhythm.
