  long_description: |
    A Dash is a movement mechanic that propels the character forward a short, fixed distance at a high speed. It can often be performed on the ground and in the air, and may be chained multiple times or combined with other actions. Unlike a dodge, a dash is primarily used for offensive repositioning or traversal rather than purely for invincibility frames, though some implementations include both.

        It's a design challenge to make crossing flat, open ground feel engaging. A dash mechanic solves this by breaking up the monotony of standard running. It introduces a rhythmic, high-speed movement option that makes simple traversal feel faster, more skillful, and more enjoyable.

        The mid-air dash is the central mechanic upon which all platforming challenges are built. The player only has one dash that refreshes upon touching the ground, turning traversal into a complex and precise puzzle.

        The Dash is a fundamental upgrade that dramatically increases X's ground speed and allows him to perform a more powerful dash-jump, forming the basis of the series' fast-paced run-and-gun platforming.
