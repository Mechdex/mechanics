    A Glide is a movement mechanic that allows a player in mid-air to dramatically slow their rate of descent and gain significant horizontal air travel. It is typically activated by holding a button after a jump. The system converts vertical momentum into controlled forward movement, allowing the player to cross large gaps or descend from great heights safely.

        In worlds with extreme verticality, a small misstep can lead to a long, fatal fall, which can be frustrating. A glide mechanic solves this by turning a potential punishment into an opportunity. It gives the player a safe and engaging way to descend from great heights and traverse massive gaps, making vertical exploration a core part of the game.

        Batman's cape allows him to glide across the rooftops of Gotham. This is his primary method of long-distance travel, and it can be combined with a grappling hook and dive-bomb maneuver to maintain speed and altitude.
