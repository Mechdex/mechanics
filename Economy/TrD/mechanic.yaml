    A Trade System is the set of rules and user interface elements that facilitates the direct exchange of items or currency between two or more parties, such as player-to-player or player-to-NPC. This can include simple two-player trading windows with an "accept" button to prevent scams, complex bartering systems with NPCs, or large-scale cargo hauling between different regions in a game world.

    - title: "Player specialization imbalance"
      description: |
        In games with specialized professions (e.g., blacksmith, alchemist), one player cannot do everything. This can be a frustrating roadblock if they need an item they can't craft. A trade system solves this by fostering interdependence. It allows specialists to profit from their skills and enables other players to acquire what they need, creating a healthy, cooperative community.
  examples:
    - title: "Path of Exile"
      description: |
        The game deliberately lacks a centralized auction house, making direct player-to-player trade its primary economic engine. Players use third-party tools to list items and then meet in-game to conduct the exchange, creating a bartering-focused community.
    - title: "Rocket League"
      description: |
        Features a trade system that allows players to exchange cosmetic items like car bodies, wheels, and decals. This created a vibrant secondary market where item rarity and player demand dictate value, entirely separate from gameplay skill.
