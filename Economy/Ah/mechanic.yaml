    An Auction House is a centralized, asynchronous marketplace system in a multiplayer game. It allows players to list items for sale for a set duration, and other players can then place bids or purchase the item outright for a "buyout" price. This system automates player-to-player trade, removing the need for both parties to be online and meet in the same location to conduct an exchange.

        It's a design challenge to facilitate trade in a persistent online world, as requiring players to meet in-game is inefficient and depends on both parties being online simultaneously. An auction house solves this by creating a centralized, asynchronous marketplace, allowing for a fluid, 24/7 player economy without the logistical headache of direct bartering.

        The Auction House is the central hub of the game's player-driven economy. It facilitates the trade of everything from basic crafting materials to legendary gear, allowing players to specialize in professions and play the market to earn gold.

        Famously featured a real-money auction house at launch. While ultimately removed, it demonstrated how this system could be used to facilitate the trade of high-value items, though its economic and game-balance implications were controversial.
