    A Social Hub is a specific, often non-combat area within a game world designated as a central meeting place for players. These hubs are intentionally designed to encourage social interaction and typically contain key vendors, quest givers, banks, and other essential services, ensuring a high volume of player traffic.

        In a large game world, the player base can be spread so thin that the world feels empty, even with thousands of players online. A social hub solves this. By concentrating players in one central location, it creates a bustling, lively area that makes the game feel populated and provides a natural space for players to meet and form groups.

        The Tower is the primary social hub where players congregate between missions. It's where players manage their inventory, pick up bounties, and show off their cosmetic gear to other players.

        The 'Gathering Hub' is a 16-player instance where players can eat meals together, arm wrestle, and form hunting parties before departing on a quest. It's designed to be the social lobby for the game's multiplayer activities.
