    A Guild System is a formal, in-game organizational structure that allows a large number of players to form a persistent group, known as a "guild," "clan," or "free company." These systems typically include a shared chat channel, a member roster, a customizable rank structure, and often a shared bank or headquarters.

        It's a design challenge to keep large groups of players organized and engaged toward a common, long-term goal. Guild systems solve this by providing a formal structure for community. They are the primary tool for organizing large-scale, end-game activities like raids and foster long-term social bonds that keep players invested in the game.

        'Free Companies' are the game's guild system. They allow players to buy a shared house, run cooperative crafting projects, and activate company-wide buffs, making them a central part of the social and progression experience.

        'Clans' are essential for competitive play. The core end-game loop involves participating in 'Clan Wars,' where one clan is pitted against another in a large-scale cooperative battle.
