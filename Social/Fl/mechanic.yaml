    A Friend List is a social feature that allows players to save other players' accounts to a persistent, cross-session list for easy access. This interface typically shows the online status of friends and provides shortcuts for inviting them to a party, sending private messages, or joining their game session directly.

      description: |
        In online games, it's a challenge for players to find and reconnect with people they enjoyed playing with in a sea of random usernames. A friend list solves this. It provides a simple, persistent tool for players to build their own social networks, making it easy to form groups and fostering a sense of community.

        Features both a server-specific friend list and a cross-server, account-wide list (Battle.net). This allows players to keep in touch with friends and easily form groups for dungeons and raids.
