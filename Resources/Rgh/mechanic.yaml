    Resource Gathering is the set of actions players perform to acquire raw materials directly from the game world. This is the primary input, or "faucet," for most crafting and building systems. The mechanic can range from a simple, instantaneous action on a resource "node" (e.g., mining an ore vein) to a complex minigame (e.g., fishing).

        A crafting system can feel abstract if materials are just bought from a shop. Resource gathering solves this by directly linking crafting to world exploration. It creates a core gameplay loop where players must actively explore the environment to acquire the materials they need to progress, making the world itself a valuable resource.
