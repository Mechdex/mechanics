    Inventory Management is the system of rules and user interface that governs a player's ability to collect, store, and organize items. Key design pillars include inventory capacity (e.g., by weight, number of slots, or a grid system), sorting functionality, and the interface for equipping, using, or discarding items. It often functions as a puzzle or strategic layer in itself.

        If a player can carry an infinite number of items, there are no meaningful choices about what to keep. A limited inventory solves this. It forces the player to make strategic decisions about what to carry and what to leave behind, turning resource management into a core gameplay challenge, especially in survival games.
  examples:
    - title: "Resident Evil 4"
      description: |
        Features a grid-based inventory system (the "attache case") where items have different shapes and sizes. Fitting everything becomes a Tetris-like spatial puzzle, forcing the player to be highly organized and make hard choices about which weapons to carry.
    - title: "Diablo II"
      description: |
        Similar to Resident Evil, it uses a grid-based inventory. The limited space and the varying shapes of items (a large axe takes up more space than a small charm) make inventory management a constant and iconic challenge.
