    Crafting Materials are a category of items whose sole purpose is to be consumed in a crafting recipe to produce another item. These materials, such as ore, wood, leather, or herbs, are gathered from the game world and form the fundamental building blocks of the in-game economy and player-driven production. They typically have no use on their own and exist only to be transformed.
