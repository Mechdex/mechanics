    Map Expansion is a narrative and world-design technique where sections of the game map are initially inaccessible to the player and are unlocked as they reach certain milestones in the story or progression. This is often represented by a "fog of war" that gets cleared, but can also be a literal barrier that is removed, revealing a new region of the world.

        Dropping a new player into a massive open world can be paralyzing and confusing. Map expansion solves this by curating the early-game experience. It guides the player through a smaller, more focused starting area, gradually revealing the full scale of the world as the player becomes more familiar with the game's mechanics.
  examples:
    - title: "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past"

        In many titles, bridges to other islands of the city are initially closed due to a hurricane warning or police lockdown. They open up systematically as the player progresses through the main story missions.
