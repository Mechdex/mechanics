    Open World is a design philosophy for game worlds that emphasizes a large, seamless or near-seamless space with a high degree of player freedom. Unlike linear games that guide the player through a set sequence of levels, an open world allows the player to choose where to go and which activities to pursue, with quests and content spread non-linearly across the map.

        A strictly linear game can feel restrictive and offer low replayability, as every player has the exact same experience. An open-world design solves this by prioritizing player agency. It provides a sandbox of systems and locations that allows for emergent gameplay and a unique, player-driven narrative path.
