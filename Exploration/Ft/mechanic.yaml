    Fast Travel is a quality-of-life mechanic that allows players to instantly teleport between previously discovered, pre-determined points on the game map. This system bypasses the normal traversal gameplay, allowing players to move across large distances without spending time running or driving. It is a key feature for reducing friction in large open-world games.

        It's a design challenge in large worlds: sending a player back and forth across a map they've already explored is tedious and pads game time. Fast travel solves this. It respects the player's time by eliminating the tedium of repeat journeys, allowing them to focus on new content and objectives.
  examples:

        Fast travel is implemented as a more immersive, diagetic system. The player must use stagecoaches, trains, or unlock a map at their camp, creating a trade-off between convenience and engaging with the world.
