    Lore Collection is a system that scatters narrative information throughout the game world in the form of collectible items, such as books, audio logs, or item descriptions. The player is encouraged to find these fragments to piece together the history and context of the world. This content is often presented in a dedicated in-game codex or journal for later review.

        A large world can feel empty if the only reason to explore is to find stat-based loot. Lore collection solves this by turning narrative into a reward. It gives players a powerful, intrinsic motivation to explore every corner of the map, rewarding their curiosity with a deeper understanding of the world's history.
