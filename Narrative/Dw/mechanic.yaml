    A Dialogue Wheel is a specific user interface for presenting branching dialogue choices in a radial menu. Options are often displayed as paraphrased intentions (e.g., "Question," "Threaten," "Sarcastic") rather than the full line of dialogue. This UI is designed for quick, intuitive selection with a controller's analog stick, making it ideal for cinematic conversations where pacing is important.

        It's a challenge to make dialogue selection feel fluid with a controller, as traditional top-to-bottom list menus can be slow to navigate. A dialogue wheel solves this by mapping choices to the analog stick's natural, radial movement. This allows for faster, more intuitive selection, which is crucial for maintaining pacing in timed or cinematic conversations.
  examples:
    - title: "Mass Effect (series)"

        The franchise popularized the dialogue wheel. Choices are consistently mapped (e.g., top-right for Paragon, bottom-right for Renegade), allowing players to make rapid, instinctual decisions that align with their character's established personality.

        Implemented a dialogue wheel where players chose a tone rather than a specific line. While controversial for its perceived lack of clarity, it demonstrated how the wheel could be used to streamline conversations into a more cinematic, action-oriented format.
