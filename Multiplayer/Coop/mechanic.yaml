    Cooperative (Co-op) Play is a mode that allows two or more players to experience a game's campaign or specific scenarios together, working towards a common goal against AI-controlled opponents (PvE). This contrasts with Player versus Player (PvP) modes, where players compete against each other.

      description: |
        It's difficult to design complex cooperative puzzles or large-scale combat encounters for a single player without overwhelming them or relying on clunky companion AI. Co-op play solves this by distributing the cognitive load across multiple humans. This enables designers to create far more complex challenges that require genuine teamwork, communication, and role specialization.
  examples:
    - title: "Left 4 Dead (series)"
      description: |
        A classic example of a purely co-op experience. The game is designed around a team of four survivors working together to fend off hordes of infected, with mechanics that actively encourage teamwork, like saving teammates from special infected.
    - title: "Portal 2"
      description: |
        Features a dedicated co-op campaign with puzzles that are impossible to solve alone. Both players are given a portal gun, and the solutions require them to coordinate their actions and use both sets of portals in tandem.
