    Voice Chat is a system, either native to the game or integrated via a platform service (like Steam Voice or Discord), that allows players in the same session to communicate in real-time using a microphone. It provides a direct, high-bandwidth channel for communication that is far more efficient than text-based chat or in-game ping systems.

        It's a challenge to coordinate complex, time-sensitive team strategy using only pings or text chat. Integrated voice chat solves this by providing a high-bandwidth, real-time communication channel. It allows for complex strategic callouts and social interaction that would be impossible with other systems.
