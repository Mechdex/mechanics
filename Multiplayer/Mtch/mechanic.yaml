    Matchmaking is an automated system that groups players together for online matches. A skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) system uses a player's performance metrics (like a hidden rating or visible rank) to attempt to create balanced teams and fair matches. Simpler systems may just prioritize finding a game as quickly as possible.

      description: |
        Without a system for balancing teams, new players are often matched against veterans, leading to frustrating, one-sided stomps that cause them to quit. Matchmaking solves this. It attempts to place players of similar skill in the same matches, which increases the likelihood of a close, engaging game and improves long-term player retention.
  examples:
    - title: "Overwatch"

        Uses a complex matchmaking system that considers not only a player's skill rating but also their preferred role (Tank, Damage, Support) to build balanced team compositions.
    - title: "League of Legends"

        Its matchmaking is based on a hidden MMR (Matchmaking Rating) for casual play and a visible rank (e.g., Bronze, Gold, Diamond) for its competitive mode, creating a clear ladder for players to climb.
