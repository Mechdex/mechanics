    Workshop Integration is a system that directly integrates a centralized, user-friendly content distribution platform (like the Steam Workshop) into the game client or launcher. This allows players to easily browse, subscribe to, download, and manage mods and other user-generated content with a single click, automating what was once a complex, manual installation process.
