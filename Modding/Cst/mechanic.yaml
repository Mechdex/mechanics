    Customization Tools are developer-provided, in-game editors that allow players to create or modify game content without needing external software. These tools can range from deep character creators and vehicle livery editors to fully-featured level builders. They provide a user-friendly, integrated way for players to engage in content creation, effectively bringing the power of modding directly into the game client itself.
