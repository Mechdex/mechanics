    Upgrading is a system of progressive, linear enhancement for a single piece of equipment. Unlike modular crafting, where parts are swapped, upgrading typically involves spending resources or currency to increase an item's existing stats (e.g., from Level 1 to Level 2). This provides a straightforward and granular path for item progression, allowing players to continually invest in their favorite gear.

      In many loot-based games, players are constantly finding new gear that makes their old, favorite items obsolete. An upgrade system solves this. It allows a player to keep their preferred weapon or armor relevant throughout the game by continually investing resources into it, fostering a stronger attachment to their equipment.
  examples:
  - title: World of Warcraft

      Players use various currencies and materials gathered from high-level content to upgrade their end-game gear through multiple ranks. This system provides a long-term progression path even after a player has acquired their "best-in-slot" items.
  - title: Assassin's Creed Odyssey

      Any piece of gear can be upgraded to match the player's current level by spending resources. This allows players to maintain a consistent visual appearance and set of legendary bonuses for their entire playthrough if they are willing to make the investment.
