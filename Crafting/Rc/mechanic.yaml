    Resource Combination is a crafting system where players create new items by placing specific raw materials in a pre-defined pattern or recipe, often using a crafting grid or menu. The core gameplay loop involves exploring the world to gather diverse ingredients (wood, stone, ore, plants, etc.) and then using them to produce tools, equipment, or structures. It is the foundational mechanic of the survival-crafting genre.

      In many games, the world is full of junk items that serve no purpose. A resource combination system solves this by giving dozens or hundreds of different world items a tangible value. A simple flower is no longer just a prop; it's a key ingredient for a potion, which encourages exploration and resource gathering.
