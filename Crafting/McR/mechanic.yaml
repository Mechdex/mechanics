    Modular Crafting is a specific type of customization where items are composed of distinct, interchangeable parts or "modules" (e.g., a gun's barrel, stock, and scope). Players craft or find these individual modules and then combine them to create a final item with unique stats and behaviors derived from its components. This allows for a vast number of potential combinations from a relatively small set of parts.

      Many crafting systems offer a linear path where there is always a single 'best' item to craft. Modular crafting solves this by creating a system of trade-offs. A long barrel might increase accuracy but slow down handling, forcing the player to make meaningful, strategic decisions about how they construct their items to fit their specific playstyle.

      The weapon and armor crafting system is entirely modular. Players can take a basic pipe pistol and, by swapping out every component, transform it into a long-range sniper rifle or a rapid-fire automatic weapon.

      Players construct their weapons by combining different tool-tips, frames, and add-ons. This allows for the creation of hybrid weapons, like a plasma cutter that also fires saw blades, encouraging player experimentation.
