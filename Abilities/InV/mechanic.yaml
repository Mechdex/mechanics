  long_description: |
    Invisibility is a stealth-oriented mechanic that masks the player character from enemy sight, enabling strategic repositioning or bypassing encounters. The implementation can range from complete visual concealment to a partial "predator-style" shimmer, often achieved with distortion or fresnel shaders that bend light around the character model. This visual cue is a key balancing factor, as it allows highly attentive enemies to spot movement.

    Beyond the visual aspect, invisibility systems are tightly integrated with the AI's sensory logic. Enemies might not see the player, but may still react to secondary stimuli like sound or environmental disturbances. Balancing is critical and typically involves limitations like a finite duration, a depletable energy pool, or the effect immediately breaking upon an aggressive action.

        A specific combat or traversal sequence can be too difficult for a portion of the player base, creating a frustrating roadblock. Invisibility functions as a player-controlled bypass for these moments. It allows a struggling player to get past a high-difficulty area without the designer needing to implement a complex dynamic difficulty system or lower the challenge for more skilled players.

        Invisibility, in the form of the 'Bend Time' and 'Shadow Walk' powers, is a cornerstone of the game's 'play your way' philosophy. It synergizes with other traversal abilities like 'Blink' but is carefully balanced by its high mana cost, forcing players to use it thoughtfully as part of a larger stealth plan.

        Active Camouflage is a classic multiplayer tool used for mind games and ambushes. Its balance is legendary: the visible shimmer during movement and the static interference it causes on the motion tracker make it a high-risk, high-reward ability that can be countered by observant opponents.
