    Regeneration is a passive character attribute that automatically restores Health Points (HP) over time. Its implementation is governed by key design levers: the rate (HP restored per second), the delay (time required out of combat before regeneration begins), and interruptibility (whether taking damage resets the delay). Unlike the burst-healing of consumable items, regeneration provides a slow, continuous resource flow that fundamentally changes the pacing between combat encounters.

        After a fight, a low-health player must stop all forward momentum to find healing items, which can kill the game's pacing. Regeneration solves this by automatically restoring health after a short delay once combat ends. This allows designers to string encounters together more closely and maintain a high-tempo pace.

      description: |
        Using finite healing items risks putting players in an unwinnable state; a player who uses too many health packs early cannot finish the level. Regeneration provides a baseline recovery method that acts as a safety net. This frees the designer from having to meticulously map out consumable placement and protects the player from being permanently punished for early mistakes.

        Defines the modern military shooter's gameplay loop. After the player avoids damage for a few seconds, health regenerates rapidly. This encourages a tactical, cover-based rhythm of popping out to shoot and ducking back to recover, removing the need for health pack management entirely.

        Implemented as a stat on gear or as a racial bonus. The regeneration is a slow trickle, less effective in active combat but highly effective for recovering from minor damage between fights. This reduces the player's reliance on a finite pool of potions for out-of-combat healing.
