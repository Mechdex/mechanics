  long_description: |
    Rage Mode is a combat-focused state change that provides a significant, temporary surge in power. It functions as a comeback mechanic or a reward for aggressive play, typically fueled by a meter that fills as the player deals and/or receives damage. Activating it transforms the player character, often unlocking a new set of powerful attacks, granting invulnerability, or providing massive boosts to damage, speed, and health regeneration.

    The feeling of overwhelming power is paramount, conveyed through dramatic audio-visual transformations. This can include changes to the character model (glowing eyes, altered physique), aggressive particle effects, a shift in the musical score, and visceral, impactful sound design for attacks. To prevent it from becoming a crutch, designers often balance it with trade-offs. Some variants might enforce a loss of fine control, pushing the player into a berserker-like frenzy, while others may apply a temporary debuff or "exhaustion" period after the effect wears off, creating a window of vulnerability.

  solved_problems:
    Hyper-passive playstyles: "Some players naturally avoid risk, leading to slow, defensive 'turtling' strategies that are less engaging. Rage Mode solves this by creating a positive feedback loop where aggressive play directly fuels a powerful reward. This incentivizes proactive combat and discourages stagnant gameplay."
    Unbalance difficulty spikes: "Sudden, sharp increases in enemy density or boss difficulty can halt player progress and cause frustration. Rage Mode acts as a player-controlled equalizer. It provides a tool to overcome these overwhelming moments, preventing player burnout and maintaining forward momentum through the toughest encounters."
  examples:
    God of War: "Spartan Rage is a perfect fusion of mechanic and narrative. It is not just a stat boost but a complete transformation where Kratos uses his bare hands, becomes unstoppable, and regains health with each hit. This embodies his character's lore and provides a tool for both aggression and survival."
    Doom Eternal: "The Berserk power-up is a contextual variant that reinforces the core 'push-forward combat' loop. As a temporary item pickup, it encourages hyper-aggression by allowing the Doom Slayer to perform one-hit 'Glory Kills' on any standard demon. This turns enemies into a resource for health and control, maintaining the game's aggressive flow."
