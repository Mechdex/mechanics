    Rage Mode is a combat-focused state change that provides a significant, temporary surge in power. It functions as a comeback mechanic or a reward for aggressive play, typically fueled by a meter that fills as the player deals and/or receives damage. Activating it transforms the player character, often unlocking new attacks or granting invulnerability.

    The feeling of power is conveyed through dramatic audio-visual transformations, like changes to the character model or sound design. Designers often balance it with trade-offs, such as a loss of fine control or a temporary debuff after the effect wears off, creating a risk-reward loop.

        Some players naturally avoid risk, leading to slow, defensive 'turtling' strategies. Rage Mode solves this by creating a positive feedback loop where aggressive play directly fuels a powerful reward. This incentivizes proactive combat and discourages stagnant gameplay.

        It can be hard to balance a game for all skill levels, and a sudden challenge can halt a player's progress. Rage Mode acts as an on-demand "power boost," giving players a tool to overcome a difficult sequence without requiring the designer to implement a dynamic difficulty system.
  examples:
    - title: "God of War"

        Spartan Rage is a perfect fusion of mechanic and narrative. It is not just a stat boost but a complete transformation where Kratos uses his bare hands, becomes unstoppable, and regains health with each hit. This embodies his character's lore and provides a tool for both aggression and survival.
    - title: "Doom Eternal"

        The Berserk power-up is a contextual variant that reinforces the core 'push-forward combat' loop. As a temporary item pickup, it encourages hyper-aggression by allowing the Doom Slayer to perform one-hit 'Glory Kills' on any standard demon. This turns enemies into a resource for health and control.
