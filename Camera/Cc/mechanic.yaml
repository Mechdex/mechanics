    A Cinematic Camera is a system that temporarily wrests camera control from the player to enforce a specific, pre-authored angle, pan, or tracking shot. It is a directorial tool used by developers during scripted sequences or key story moments. By dictating the camera's behavior, the system can guarantee a dramatic presentation, highlight important details, or guide the player's focus, much like a film director framing a shot.

  - title: Missing critical visual information
    description: |
      It's a design challenge that during a key story moment, the player might be looking in the wrong direction and miss the important event. A cinematic camera solves this by temporarily taking control to frame the action perfectly. It ensures every player sees the critical narrative beat exactly as the designer intended.
  examples:
  - title: Uncharted (series)

      The series seamlessly blends gameplay with cinematic camera work. During large set-piece moments, like a collapsing building, the camera will pull back or shift to a dramatic angle to emphasize the scale and spectacle, even while the player retains character control.
  - title: God of War (2018)
