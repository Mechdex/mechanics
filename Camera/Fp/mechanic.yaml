  long_description: |
    First-Person View is a camera perspective where the viewpoint is placed within the character's head, showing the game world from their eyes. The player character's body is typically not rendered, with the exception of their hands, arms, and any held items like weapons or tools. This perspective offers a direct, unfiltered view of the game world, prioritizing immersion and direct aiming.
  short_description: Immersive first-person perspective.
  solved_problems:
  - title: Player-character disconnect
    description: |
      A third-person view can create a sense of controlling a puppet or avatar rather than being the character. A first-person view solves this by directly placing the player within the character's body. This creates a powerful sense of immersion and presence, as the player sees the world directly through the character's eyes.

  - title: Cyberpunk 2077
    description: |
      The game uses its mandatory first-person view to enhance immersion in its detailed world. Conversations, combat, and environmental interactions are all experienced directly from the protagonist's viewpoint to ground the player in the role.
