    An Over-the-Shoulder view is a specific type of third-person perspective where the camera is positioned closely behind and slightly to one side of the player character. This view typically frames the character from the waist up, providing a clear line of sight past them that is ideal for aiming ranged weapons, while still keeping the player character visible for situational awareness.

  - title: Aiming vs situational awareness conflict
    description: |
      First-person offers perfect aiming but a narrow view, while a traditional distant third-person view offers a wide view but makes aiming imprecise. The over-the-shoulder view is the design solution to this conflict. It offers a clear, unobstructed line of sight for aiming while still keeping the player character in frame for strong situational awareness.

      Combined the over-the-shoulder view with a cover system. The camera dynamically shifts to give the player the best possible view for aiming out of cover, making tactical, cover-based shooting feel responsive and intuitive.
