    A Free Camera is a mode, often distinct from normal gameplay, where the player can detach the viewpoint from the character and move it independently through the 3D space. This mode frequently includes a suite of photographic tools, such as field-of-view (FoV) adjustment, depth of field controls, color filters, and the ability to pause or advance time. It is the core component of a "Photo Mode."

      Players often want to capture and share their unique experiences, but the standard game camera is restrictive and utilitarian. A free camera, especially in a 'Photo Mode,' provides a creative toolset for players to engage with the game world non-destructively. It fosters community engagement by turning the game into a virtual photography studio.
  examples:
  - title: Marvel's Spider-Man

      Its photo mode allows players to set up complex lighting rigs within a scene in addition to standard free camera controls. This gives players an incredible amount of creative power to re-light and re-frame the game's world.
