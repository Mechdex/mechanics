        It's a design challenge to keep players engaged after they've mastered the core gameplay. Unlockables solve this by providing a clear set of extrinsic goals. The desire to unlock a new character or a cool weapon skin provides a powerful motivation for players to continue playing and engage with different aspects of the game.
  examples:
    - title: "Super Smash Bros. (series)"

        The multiplayer progression is built almost entirely around unlockables. Players earn new weapons, attachments, perks, and cosmetic camos by leveling up and completing specific in-game challenges.
