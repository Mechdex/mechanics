    A Skill Tree is a visual representation of a character's progression path, where skills and abilities are laid out in a branching, tree-like structure. Players spend points (often earned by leveling up) to unlock nodes on the tree. More powerful abilities are typically located further down a branch, requiring investment in prerequisite, lower-tier skills to reach them.

        A long, unstructured list of unlockable abilities can be overwhelming and doesn't communicate long-term goals. A skill tree solves this by visualizing the entire progression path. It allows players to plan their build in advance and make informed decisions about their character's development, providing a clear roadmap for their progression.

        Each Vault Hunter has multiple skill trees that focus on different playstyles. The final skill in each tree is a powerful "capstone" ability that dramatically changes gameplay, heavily incentivizing specialization.
