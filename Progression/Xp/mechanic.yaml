    Experience Points (XP or EXP) are a numerical value awarded to players for completing in-game actions, such as winning battles, finishing quests, or discovering new locations. XP is the fundamental "currency" for the Leveling Up system; accumulating a specific amount of XP is what causes a character to gain a level and become more powerful.

        Players can feel like their time is being wasted if minor actions, like defeating a weak enemy, have no tangible reward. An experience point system solves this. By assigning an XP value to nearly every positive action, it ensures that the player is always making measurable progress towards their next level, no matter how small the task.

        The classic implementation where each defeated enemy grants a set amount of XP, which is divided among the party members. Grinding battles to accumulate XP is a core gameplay loop of the series.

        Features a skill-based experience system. Instead of getting XP for quests, the player gains XP in a specific skill (e.g., 'One-Handed' or 'Smithing') by using it. Gaining skill levels is what contributes to the overall character level.
