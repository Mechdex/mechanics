    Leveling Up is a core RPG progression system where a player character earns Experience Points (XP) for completing tasks. Upon reaching a certain XP threshold, the character's "Level" increases. This typically grants an automatic increase in base statistics (like health and damage) and often awards points to spend in other systems, like Skill Trees or perks.

        It can be difficult for players to feel a tangible sense of growth over a long game. A leveling system solves this by providing a clear, quantifiable measure of progress. The constant feedback of gaining XP and leveling up creates a powerful and addictive psychological loop that keeps players invested.
  examples:

        Each Pokémon levels up individually by participating in battles. Leveling up not only increases their stats but is also the primary way they learn new moves and evolve into more powerful forms.
