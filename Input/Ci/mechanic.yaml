    A Combo Input is a method, primarily in fighting games, that requires the player to perform a specific sequence of directional inputs and button presses within a strict timing window to execute a special move. This can range from simple quarter-circle motions (down, down-forward, forward + punch) to complex, multi-step chains of inputs that require significant muscle memory to perform consistently.

    - title: "Limited moveset on a simple controller"
      description: |
        It's a fundamental design limitation: a controller has only a few face buttons, which can only support a small number of unique attacks. Combo inputs solve this. They dramatically expand a character's moveset by using sequences and combinations of the same few buttons to unlock dozens of different special moves.
  examples:
    - title: "Street Fighter (series)"

        The franchise codified the use of charge motions (holding back for two seconds, then forward + punch) and circular motions for special moves, creating the foundational input language for the entire fighting game genre.
    - title: "Mortal Kombat (series)"

        Known for its 'Fatalities,' which require a long, specific combo input to be performed after winning a match. This turns the finishing move into a final, memorable skill check for the victorious player.
