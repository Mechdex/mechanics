    Gesture Recognition is a control scheme that uses a camera or other sensor to track the player's body movements and translate them into in-game actions. The system is programmed to recognize pre-defined physical gestures, like swinging an arm, making a specific pose, or a full-body dance move, and uses them as direct inputs.

        It's a design challenge to make a game about a physical activity like dancing or boxing feel intuitive with just a controller. Gesture recognition solves this by creating a direct, one-to-one link between the player's physical actions and the on-screen character's movements, providing a more immersive and intuitive control scheme for physical games.
  examples:
    - title: "Just Dance (series)"

        The core mechanic involves players mimicking the on-screen dancer's choreography. A camera or motion controller tracks the player's body and scores them based on how accurately they perform the gestures.
