    Voice Input is an input method that allows players to control in-game actions by speaking into a microphone. This system uses speech recognition technology to parse player speech and map it to specific commands within the game's control scheme. It is often used as an alternative or supplement to traditional controller or keyboard inputs, allowing for hands-free control of certain actions.

      description: |
        In complex games like strategy titles or simulators, issuing commands to units often requires navigating through multiple nested menus, which is slow and cumbersome. Voice input can solve this by providing direct shortcuts. A player can simply say "Unit 3, move to Sector Alpha" instead of clicking through several UI elements, streamlining complex actions.

        Voice input is used for both gameplay and immersion. Players must speak to the ghosts using specific phrases to elicit a response, making the player's own voice a core part of the paranormal investigation loop.
