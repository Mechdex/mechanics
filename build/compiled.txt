The core implementation involves scaling down the global game clock, affecting everything from enemy movement and projectile speed to environmental physics. Crucially, player input processing\u2014such as aiming and shooting\u2014remains close to a 1:1 response time. This creates a disparity where the player can perceive and act within a slowed-down world.\n\nEffective Bullet Time relies heavily on strong audio-visual feedback. Common techniques include desaturating the screen's color palette, adding motion blur or tracer effects to fast-moving objects, and muffling ambient audio while emphasizing key sounds like heartbeats or bullet impacts. The activation is often tied to a depletable resource meter to encourage strategic use.\n",
